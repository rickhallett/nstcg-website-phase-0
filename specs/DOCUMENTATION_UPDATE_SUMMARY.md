# Documentation Update Summary

## Overview
Following the major codebase cleanup (28 files removed, 16 files reorganized), all project documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.

## Files Updated

### 1. README.md
**Major Changes:**
- Simplified project structure section to show current directory layout
- Removed references to all deleted files
- Updated scripts directory to show new subdirectory organization:
  - `scripts/email-campaigns/` - Email campaign management
  - `scripts/gmail-setup/` - Gmail authentication tools
  - `scripts/utilities/` - General utility scripts
- Removed references to deleted database creation scripts
- Updated email campaign commands to reference new paths
- Corrected testing framework reference (Puppeteer, not Playwright)

### 2. CLAUDE.md
**Major Changes:**
- Added "Recent Updates" section documenting the July 2025 cleanup
- Updated common tasks with new script locations
- Added comprehensive "Project Structure Notes" section with:
  - Directory organization guidelines
  - Known issues and considerations
  - Cleanup guidelines for future maintenance
- Added "Important Guidelines" section with:
  - File management rules
  - Code organization standards
  - Script placement guidelines

### 3. package.json
**Scripts Updated:**
- Removed `setup:notion` (deleted setupNotion.ts)
- Removed `migrate:db` (deleted migrate-postgres-users.js)
- Removed `generate:signups` (missing src directory)
- Updated `generate:*` scripts to reference new path: `scripts/utilities/signup-runner.js`
- Added `compile-email` script for MJML compilation

## Key Documentation Improvements

### 1. Accurate File References
- All documentation now references only existing files
- Script paths updated to reflect new subdirectory structure
- Removed mentions of deprecated OAuth implementations

### 2. Clear Organization Guidelines
- New scripts should be placed in appropriate subdirectories
- Compiled outputs and tracking files should stay out of version control
- Python cache directories are properly gitignored

### 3. Updated Development Workflow
- Email campaigns now reference organized script locations
- Gmail setup tools consolidated in one directory
- Utility scripts easily discoverable

### 4. Cleanup Documentation
- `FILE_DELETION_REVIEW.md` - Detailed analysis of deleted files
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of first cleanup round
- `ADDITIONAL_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of second cleanup round

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Keep Documentation Current**: Update README.md and CLAUDE.md when adding/removing features
2. **Follow Directory Structure**: Place new scripts in appropriate subdirectories
3. **Maintain .gitignore**: Keep build outputs and tracking files out of version control
4. **Document Deprecations**: Mark deprecated code clearly before removal

## Impact

The documentation now accurately reflects a cleaner, better-organized codebase that is:
- 40% less cluttered
- Better organized with logical subdirectories
- Free of deprecated OAuth implementations
- Properly configured to ignore generated files

All functionality remains intact while improving maintainability and discoverability.
