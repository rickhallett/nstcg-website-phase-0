#### BDD Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Community Engagement Rewards
  As an active participant
  I want to earn recognition for my contributions
  So that I feel motivated to continue

  Scenario: Earn first reporter badge
    Given I am a new user
    When I report my first traffic incident
    Then I should receive the "First Reporter" badge
    And I should earn 10 action points
    And the badge should appear on my profile

  Scenario: Climb neighborhood leaderboard
    Given I have earned 100 points this week
    When the weekly leaderboard updates
    Then I should see my ranking for my neighborhood
    And I should see how many points to next rank
```

#### TDD Test Requirements
```javascript
// Unit Tests
describe('PointCalculator', () => {
  test('should award points for actions', () => {});
  test('should apply multipliers correctly', () => {});
  test('should prevent point manipulation', () => {});
});

describe('AchievementEngine', () => {
  test('should trigger achievements on conditions', () => {});
  test('should prevent duplicate badges', () => {});
  test('should calculate progress accurately', () => {});
});
```

    When I select a story template
    And I customize it with my message
    Then I should be able to download it
    And share it to my Instagram story

  Scenario: Schedule tweet storm
    Given I want to coordinate a Twitter campaign
    When I prepare 5 related tweets
    And I schedule them for tomorrow at 9 AM
    Then they should post automatically
    And I should see engagement metrics
```

#### BDD Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Campaign Progress Visibility
  As a supporter
  I want to see our campaign progress
  So that I stay motivated and informed

  Scenario: View campaign timeline
